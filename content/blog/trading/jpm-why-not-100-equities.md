# Why you shouldn’t go 100% into stocks

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon an old finance discussion on Reddit where someone mentioned a 1996 paper titled _“Why Not 100% Equities”_ by Clifford Asness.
The title immediately caught my eye. I’ve heard so many people, from online gurus to long-term investors, say that “stocks always win in the long run.”
But this paper completely changed how I think about risk, diversification, and the idea of “going all in.”

## The question: Why not 100% equities

Thaler and Williamson once asked a simple question in their 1994 paper: why shouldn’t university endowment funds invest 100% in equities, since stocks have outperformed bonds over history?

Clifford Asness, a quantitative researcher at Goldman Sachs at the time, took that question and flipped it on its head.
His response was: just because stocks have higher historical returns doesn’t mean a 100% stock portfolio is the smartest choice.

## Two questions every investor must separate

Asness explained that many investors confuse two separate decisions:

1. How much total risk they are willing to take
2. How to allocate that risk across different assets

Even if you’re comfortable with more risk, you don’t need to take that risk by holding only one asset class.
You can build a diversified portfolio that’s more efficient-earning higher returns per unit of risk-and then simply adjust your total exposure with leverage if needed.

## What the data says

Asness looked at data from 1926 to 1993 and compared three portfolios: 100% stocks, 100% bonds, and a balanced mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds.

Over that period, 1 USD invested in 1926 would have grown to about 800 USD in stocks, 330 USD in the 60/40 mix, and only 40 USD in bonds.
So yes, stocks made the most money. But when you factor in volatility, the 60/40 portfolio actually had the best risk-adjusted performance.

Here’s why that matters: a higher Sharpe ratio means you’re earning more return for every unit of risk you take. The 60/40 portfolio gave you a smoother and more efficient path to growth than 100% stocks.

## The smarter approach: diversify, then lever

Modern portfolio theory teaches that the optimal portfolio of risky assets-the one on the “efficient frontier”-is usually a mix of stocks and bonds.
Once you’ve built that optimal mix, you can scale your total risk up or down by adjusting leverage.

Asness calculated that if you leveraged the 60/40 portfolio by about 1.55 times, you’d have the same volatility as 100% equities-but with higher returns.

In his data, 100% stocks earned about 10.3% annually with 20% volatility, while the levered 60/40 portfolio earned 11.1% with that same 20% volatility.

In other words, a balanced portfolio with leverage beat pure stocks without taking extra risk.

## What about the danger of leverage

Leverage often sounds scary, but Asness put it to the test by looking at the worst months and years on record.

During 1926-1993, the worst year for stocks was a 67% loss. The worst year for a levered 60/40 portfolio was about 66%.
They both suffered badly, but the difference wasn’t dramatic.

This shows that leverage, when applied to a diversified base, doesn’t automatically mean “disaster.” It just amplifies the same risks already present in the market.

## If you can’t or don’t want to use leverage

Not every investor can borrow money to lever a portfolio. Asness offered an alternative: broaden your diversification within the stock market itself.

Adding smaller companies (small-cap stocks) can increase expected return without the need for borrowing.
For instance, a 60% small stocks and 40% bonds portfolio performed nearly as well as 100% large stocks, but with less volatility.

Diversification remains the most powerful lever you can use, even without literal leverage.

## Does time make stocks safer

Many investors believe that stocks become “safe” over the long run. Asness agreed partly: over 10, 20, or 30 years, stocks are very likely to outperform bonds.
But he emphasized that this doesn’t mean risk disappears.

Even long-term investors face timing risk-especially if they’re forced to withdraw during a downturn.
Time helps, but it doesn’t eliminate the value of diversification.

## The equilibrium perspective

Asness also approached the problem from a theoretical angle. In market equilibrium, every asset must be held by someone.
If everyone decided to own only stocks, who would hold the bonds?

This simple observation reinforces that diversified portfolios are not just efficient-they are necessary for markets to function properly.

## The core idea

Asness’s central argument is timeless:

Even long-term investors shouldn’t go 100% into equities. A diversified portfolio-especially one that can be modestly levered-delivers higher returns per unit of risk.

He emphasized two steps for all investors.
First, find the mix of assets that gives the best trade-off between risk and return.
Second, choose how much total risk to take based on your goals and comfort level.

A 100% equity portfolio skips the first step entirely and ends up being suboptimal.

## What this means for individual investors

If you’re a long-term investor, diversification is not a compromise-it’s an advantage.
Bonds are not your enemy; they stabilize your portfolio and make your returns more consistent.
And if you truly want higher returns, the solution isn’t to pile into stocks, but to scale up a diversified portfolio intelligently.

Asness’s research reminds us that investing isn’t about being fearless, it’s about being efficient.

## The lesson about diversification

The biggest takeaway from Asness’s paper is simple but profound:

Diversification doesn’t just reduce risk-it increases efficiency.
It allows your money to work harder for every unit of risk you take.

Even if you believe in the long-term power of stocks, blending them with bonds or other assets makes your portfolio more resilient, more predictable, and ultimately more rewarding.

A 100% equity portfolio may look bold, but true wisdom lies in balance.
