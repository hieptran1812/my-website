## Introduction

I’ve always loved finance, but my background isn’t actually in this field. So, I wanted to find a book that could help me learn finance from scratch. Corporate Finance might be the perfect one to start with.

To capture my thoughts and the interesting things I come across while reading, I decided to turn my notes into blog posts here. If you’re reading this, just think of it as my personal study notes, like something I’d jot down while learning at school.

Maybe these notes are just for me :)) but if they help you too, that’s even better!

## The Birth of the Modern American Corporation

The modern U.S. corporation began with the Dartmouth College v. Woodward case in 1819. Before this case, the government could take control of private companies, and their property was not clearly protected by the Constitution.

Dartmouth College, a private school, was taken over by the New Hampshire state government in 1816. The college sued, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1819 that a corporation is a “contract.” This means the state cannot change or cancel it without violating the Constitution.

This decision protected private corporations from government interference and guaranteed their property rights. It marked the birth of the modern American business corporation.

The corporate structure is now common worldwide and keeps evolving. The 2008 financial crisis reshaped global finance, leading to major reforms and raising questions about government involvement in private corporations.

## The four types of Firms

### Sole Proprietorships

A sole proprietorship is a business owned and run by one person. It’s simple to start and very common, about 72% of U.S. businesses are sole proprietorships, but they generate only around 4% of total revenue.

Key points:

1. Easy and inexpensive to set up.
2. The owner and business are legally the same, so there can be only one owner.
3. The owner has unlimited personal liability for all business debts.
4. The business ends when the owner dies and is hard to transfer.

Because of these drawbacks, most owners switch to other business forms once their company grows or needs to limit personal liability.

### Partnerships

A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. All partners are responsible for the firm’s debts, and the business can end if a partner dies or leaves unless an agreement allows otherwise. Partnerships are common in professions such as law, medicine, and accounting.

A limited partnership includes general partners and limited partners. General partners manage the business and are personally liable for its debts. Limited partners only invest money, have limited liability, and cannot take part in management decisions.

Industries like private equity and venture capital often use limited partnerships. In these firms, general partners handle investments and operations, while limited partners provide capital and only monitor results.

### Limit Liability Companies

A limited liability company or LLC is similar to a partnership but all owners have limited liability and can also manage the business. It is a newer business form in the United States, first allowed in Wyoming in 1977 and last adopted by Hawaii in 1997.

In other countries, limited liability companies have existed for over a century. The concept started in Germany as GmbH and later spread across Europe and Latin America. In France it is called SARL, in Italy SRL, and in Spain SL.

### Corporations

A corporation is a legally created entity separate from its owners. It can make contracts, own property, and is responsible for its own debts. The owners are not personally liable for the company’s obligations.

Corporations must be legally formed, often through a process called incorporation, which involves filing formal documents with the state. Many corporations choose to incorporate in Delaware because of its favorable laws.

Ownership is divided into shares called stock, and shareholders own parts of the company. They may receive dividend payments based on the number of shares they hold. There is no limit on how many owners a corporation can have, and anyone can buy or sell shares freely.

This structure allows corporations to raise large amounts of money by selling shares to investors. Because of this ability to attract outside funding, corporations have become the dominant form of business. Large corporations such as Walmart illustrate this power, employing millions of people and generating hundreds of billions in revenue each year.

### Tax Implications for Corporate Entities

Corporations are taxed separately from their owners. This means profits are taxed twice: once at the corporate level and again when profits are paid out as dividends to shareholders. This is called double taxation.

For example, if a company earns 5 USD per share and pays a 40% corporate tax (2 USD), 3 USD remains. Shareholders then pay a 15% tax on their dividend income (0.45 USD), leaving 2.55 USD per share after all taxes. The total effective tax rate is 49%.

S corporations are different because they avoid double taxation. Their profits and losses go directly to shareholders, who report them on their personal tax returns. After shareholders pay income tax on these profits, no further tax is required.

Normally, a corporation is subject to double taxation.

First, the company must pay corporate income tax on its profits.

Second, when those profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends, the shareholders must also pay personal income tax on the dividend income.

However, an S Corporation is a special type of company under U.S. tax law. The company’s profits and losses are not taxed at the corporate level.

Instead, the profits are passed directly to shareholders according to their ownership share. Shareholders then report these profits on their personal tax returns, even if no cash has been distributed yet. Once the shareholders pay personal income tax, no further tax is charged.

For example, if the company earns 5 USD per share and has S Corporation status, it does not pay any corporate tax. Instead, you as the shareholder pay personal income tax directly on the earnings. With a 30% personal tax rate, you would pay 1.50 USD in tax (0.30 × 5 USD). This is much lower than the 2.45 USD paid in the double-taxation example for a regular corporation.

However, there are strict rules for S Corporations. Shareholders must be individuals who are U.S. citizens or residents, and there can be no more than 100 shareholders. Large companies do not qualify for this status because they often have many shareholders or foreign investors.

Most large corporations are C Corporations, which pay corporate taxes. S Corporations make up less than 25% of total corporate revenue in the United States.
