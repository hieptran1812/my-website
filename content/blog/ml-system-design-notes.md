# Machine Learning System Design: Building Robust ML Pipelines

![ML System Architecture](/blog-placeholder.jpg)

These notes summarize key concepts for designing production-ready machine learning systems. From data ingestion to model serving, every component requires careful consideration for scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## System Design Principles

### Core Requirements

When designing ML systems, consider these fundamental requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**

- Model training and inference
- Data processing and validation
- Feature engineering and storage
- Model versioning and deployment

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Scalability:** Handle increasing data and traffic
- **Reliability:** High availability and fault tolerance
- **Performance:** Low latency and high throughput
- **Maintainability:** Easy to update and debug

### Key Components

```
Data Sources → Data Pipeline → Feature Store → Model Training → Model Serving → Monitoring
      ↓              ↓             ↓             ↓             ↓            ↓
   Storage       Processing    Features     Experiments   Inference    Metrics
```

## Data Pipeline Architecture

### Data Ingestion

**Batch Processing:**

- Scheduled ETL jobs (Apache Airflow, Luigi)
- Good for historical analysis and training data
- Higher latency but better for complex transformations

**Stream Processing:**

- Real-time data processing (Apache Kafka, Apache Flink)
- Low latency for real-time features
- More complex error handling

```python
# Example batch pipeline with Airflow
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

def extract_data():
    # Extract from various sources
    pass

def transform_data():
    # Clean and transform
    pass

def load_data():
    # Load to feature store
    pass

dag = DAG('ml_data_pipeline')
extract = PythonOperator(task_id='extract', python_callable=extract_data)
transform = PythonOperator(task_id='transform', python_callable=transform_data)
load = PythonOperator(task_id='load', python_callable=load_data)

extract >> transform >> load
```

### Data Validation

**Schema Validation:**

- Ensure data types and formats are correct
- Detect missing or unexpected columns
- Validate value ranges and distributions

**Data Quality Checks:**

- Statistical tests for data drift
- Anomaly detection in features
- Completeness and consistency checks

### Feature Engineering

**Feature Store Benefits:**

- Centralized feature management
- Feature reuse across teams
- Point-in-time correctness
- Feature lineage tracking

## Model Training Pipeline

### Experiment Management

**Track Everything:**

- Model hyperparameters
- Training metrics
- Data versions
- Code versions
- Environment configurations

```python
# Example with MLflow
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 6)

    # Train model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Log metrics
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)

    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

### Model Validation

**Validation Strategy:**

- Train/validation/test splits
- Cross-validation for robust estimates
- Hold-out test set for final evaluation

**Performance Metrics:**

- Business metrics (revenue, engagement)
- Model metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Infrastructure metrics (latency, throughput)

## Model Serving Architecture

### Serving Patterns

**Batch Prediction:**

```python
# Scheduled batch inference
def batch_predict():
    # Load model
    model = load_model("s3://models/model_v1.pkl")

    # Load data
    data = load_data("s3://data/batch_input.parquet")

    # Generate predictions
    predictions = model.predict(data)

    # Store results
    save_predictions(predictions, "s3://results/predictions.parquet")
```

**Online Prediction:**

```python
# Real-time API serving
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
model = load_model("model.pkl")

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    features = extract_features(data)
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})
```

**Streaming Prediction:**

```python
# Real-time stream processing
from kafka import KafkaConsumer, KafkaProducer

consumer = KafkaConsumer('input_stream')
producer = KafkaProducer('predictions')

for message in consumer:
    data = json.loads(message.value)
    features = extract_features(data)
    prediction = model.predict([features])

    result = {'id': data['id'], 'prediction': prediction[0]}
    producer.send('predictions', json.dumps(result))
```

### Model Deployment Strategies

**Blue-Green Deployment:**

- Two identical environments (blue = current, green = new)
- Zero downtime switching
- Easy rollback capability

**Canary Deployment:**

- Gradual rollout to small percentage of traffic
- Monitor performance before full deployment
- Risk mitigation for new models

**A/B Testing:**

- Split traffic between models
- Compare business metrics
- Data-driven model selection

## Monitoring and Observability

### Model Performance Monitoring

**Data Drift Detection:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

def detect_drift(reference_data, current_data, threshold=0.05):
    """Detect distribution drift using KS test"""
    for column in reference_data.columns:
        statistic, p_value = stats.ks_2samp(
            reference_data[column],
            current_data[column]
        )

        if p_value < threshold:
            print(f"Drift detected in {column}: p-value = {p_value}")
            return True
    return False
```

**Model Drift Detection:**

- Track prediction distributions
- Monitor confidence scores
- Compare with validation performance

**Business Metrics:**

- Revenue impact
- User engagement
- Conversion rates
- Customer satisfaction

### Infrastructure Monitoring

**System Metrics:**

- CPU and memory usage
- Request latency and throughput
- Error rates and availability
- Queue depths and processing times

**Custom Metrics:**

```python
# Example monitoring with Prometheus
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Prediction counters
predictions_total = Counter('ml_predictions_total', 'Total predictions made')
prediction_errors = Counter('ml_prediction_errors_total', 'Prediction errors')

# Latency histogram
prediction_latency = Histogram('ml_prediction_duration_seconds', 'Prediction latency')

# Model performance gauge
model_accuracy = Gauge('ml_model_accuracy', 'Current model accuracy')

@prediction_latency.time()
def predict(features):
    try:
        prediction = model.predict(features)
        predictions_total.inc()
        return prediction
    except Exception as e:
        prediction_errors.inc()
        raise
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

**Model Serving:**

- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Auto-scaling based on traffic
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)

**Data Processing:**

- Distributed computing (Spark, Dask)
- Parallel feature extraction
- Sharded data storage

### Caching Strategies

**Feature Caching:**

```python
import redis

redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

def get_features(user_id):
    # Check cache first
    cached_features = redis_client.get(f"features:{user_id}")

    if cached_features:
        return json.loads(cached_features)

    # Compute features if not cached
    features = compute_features(user_id)

    # Cache for future use
    redis_client.setex(
        f"features:{user_id}",
        3600,  # 1 hour TTL
        json.dumps(features)
    )

    return features
```

**Prediction Caching:**

- Cache frequent predictions
- Use content-based keys
- Implement cache invalidation

## Security and Privacy

- Cost-effective storage tiers

### Model Efficiency

**Model Optimization:**

```python
# Model quantization example
import torch

# Quantize model for faster inference
quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model,
    {torch.nn.Linear},
    dtype=torch.qint8
)

# Model distillation
def distill_model(teacher_model, student_model, train_data):
    # Train smaller student model to mimic teacher
    pass
```
