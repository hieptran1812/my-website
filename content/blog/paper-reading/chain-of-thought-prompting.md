# Chain of Thought Prompting in Large Language Models

## Introduction

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by encouraging them to generate intermediate reasoning steps.

## Methodology

The paper introduces a simple yet effective approach:

- Provide examples with step-by-step reasoning
- Encourage the model to "think out loud"
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps

## Results

CoT prompting shows significant improvements on:

- Arithmetic reasoning
- Commonsense reasoning
- Symbolic reasoning tasks

## Impact

This work has influenced numerous follow-up studies and has become a standard technique in LLM applications requiring complex reasoning.
