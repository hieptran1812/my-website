# Whisper: Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision

OpenAI's Whisper represents a significant advancement in automatic speech recognition, demonstrating that large-scale weak supervision can produce remarkably robust models that generalize across languages, accents, and acoustic conditions.

## Introduction

Traditional ASR systems often struggle with robustnessâ€”performing well on clean, in-domain data but failing on accented speech, background noise, or domain mismatches. Whisper addresses these limitations through massive-scale training on diverse, weakly supervised data.

## Training Data and Methodology

### Dataset Scale and Diversity

Whisper was trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual audio:

- **Web Sources**: Audio transcripts from various online sources
- **99 Languages**: Covering major world languages
- **Diverse Conditions**: Multiple acoustic environments and speaking styles
- **Weak Supervision**: Automated transcripts with varying quality

### Training Approach

**Sequence-to-Sequence Architecture**:

- Encoder-decoder Transformer design
- Direct optimization for transcription accuracy
- End-to-end training without intermediate steps

**Multi-task Training**:

- Speech recognition in multiple languages
- Speech translation to English
- Language identification
- Voice activity detection

## Architecture Design

### Encoder-Decoder Structure

**Audio Encoder**:

- Processes 30-second audio chunks
- Log-mel spectrogram input (80 channels)
- Convolutional stem followed by Transformer blocks
- Sinusoidal positional encoding

**Text Decoder**:

- Autoregressive generation of transcripts
- Cross-attention to encoder representations
- Multi-head self-attention for language modeling
- Special tokens for task specification

### Model Variants

Whisper comes in multiple sizes:

- **Tiny**: 39M parameters, fastest inference
- **Base**: 74M parameters, balanced performance
- **Small**: 244M parameters, good accuracy
- **Medium**: 769M parameters, higher quality
- **Large**: 1.5B parameters, best performance

## Key Innovations

### Robust Training Paradigm

**Weak Supervision Benefits**:

- Tolerates imperfect transcripts
- Learns from diverse error patterns
- Builds robustness through data diversity
- Scales beyond manually annotated data

### Multi-task Framework

The model simultaneously learns:

1. **Transcription**: Convert speech to text
2. **Translation**: Translate non-English speech to English text
3. **Language Detection**: Identify the input language
4. **Timestamp Prediction**: Align text with audio timing

### Special Token Design

Whisper uses special tokens to control behavior:

- `<|startoftranscript|>`: Beginning of output
- `<|en|>`: Language specification
- `<|translate|>`: Translation task
- `<|transcribe|>`: Transcription task
- `<|notimestamps|>`: No timestamp prediction

## Performance Analysis
