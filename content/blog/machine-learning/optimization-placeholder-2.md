# Gradient Descent Variants and Optimization Techniques

This article explores different variants of gradient descent and optimization techniques commonly used in machine learning model training.

## Classical Gradient Descent

Understanding the foundational concepts of gradient descent and its mathematical principles.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

How SGD improves upon batch gradient descent by using random samples, making it more suitable for large datasets.

## Advanced Optimizers

Modern optimization algorithms that have become standard in deep learning:

### Adam Optimizer

- Adaptive learning rates
- Momentum incorporation
- Bias correction

### RMSprop

- Root Mean Square Propagation
- Adaptive learning rate method

### AdaGrad

- Learning rate adaptation

## Optimization Strategies

Best practices for choosing and tuning optimizers:

- **Learning rate scheduling**: Techniques for adjusting learning rates during training
- **Momentum parameters**: Optimizing momentum for better convergence
- **Regularization**: Preventing overfitting during optimization

## Practical Implementation

Guidelines for implementing these optimization techniques in real-world scenarios and choosing the right optimizer for your specific use case.
