# Deep Reinforcement Learning: From Q-Learning to Policy Gradients

![Reinforcement Learning Environment](/blog-placeholder.jpg)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) represents one of the most exciting frontiers in artificial intelligence, enabling agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment. This comprehensive guide covers the journey from classical RL algorithms to cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning techniques.

## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, RL doesn't require labeled data—instead, the agent learns from the consequences of its actions.

### Key Components

- **Agent:** The decision-maker
- **Environment:** The world the agent interacts with
- **State (S):** Current situation of the agent
- **Action (A):** What the agent can do
- **Reward (R):** Feedback from the environment
- **Policy (π):** Strategy for choosing actions

## Mathematical Framework

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)

RL problems are formalized as MDPs defined by:

- **States:** $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$
- **Actions:** $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_m\}$
- **Transition probabilities:** $P(s'|s,a)$
- **Reward function:** $R(s,a,s')$
- **Discount factor:** $\gamma \in [0,1]$

### Value Functions

**State Value Function:**
$$V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_{t+1} | S_0 = s, \pi]$$

**Action Value Function (Q-function):**
$$Q^\pi(s,a) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_{t+1} | S_0 = s, A_0 = a, \pi]$$

## Classical Q-Learning

### The Q-Learning Algorithm

Q-Learning is a model-free algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function:

$$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$$

```python
import numpy as np
import random

class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, n_states, n_actions, learning_rate=0.1,
                 discount_factor=0.95, epsilon=0.1):
        self.n_states = n_states
        self.n_actions = n_actions
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.gamma = discount_factor
        self.epsilon = epsilon

        # Initialize Q-table
        self.q_table = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

    def choose_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return random.randint(0, self.n_actions - 1)  # Explore
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])  # Exploit

    def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        current_q = self.q_table[state, action]

        if done:
            target_q = reward
        else:
            target_q = reward + self.gamma * np.max(self.q_table[next_state])

        self.q_table[state, action] = current_q + self.lr * (target_q - current_q)
```

### Exploration vs Exploitation

The epsilon-greedy strategy balances exploration and exploitation:

```python
def epsilon_greedy_policy(q_values, epsilon):
    if random.random() < epsilon:
        return random.choice(range(len(q_values)))  # Explore
    else:
        return np.argmax(q_values)  # Exploit
```

## Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

### From Tables to Neural Networks

When state spaces become large or continuous, Q-tables become impractical. DQN uses neural networks to approximate Q-values:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.network(x)

class DQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, lr=0.001):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.memory = []
        self.epsilon = 1.0
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01

        # Neural networks
        self.q_network = DQN(state_size, 64, action_size)
        self.target_network = DQN(state_size, 64, action_size)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.q_network.parameters(), lr=lr)

    def act(self, state):
        if np.random.random() <= self.epsilon:
            return random.choice(np.arange(self.action_size))

        state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
        q_values = self.q_network(state_tensor)
        return np.argmax(q_values.cpu().data.numpy())
```

### Experience Replay

Store and sample experiences to break correlation between consecutive samples:

```python
from collections import deque
import random

class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, buffer_size, batch_size):
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=buffer_size)
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def add(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        experience = (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        self.memory.append(experience)

    def sample(self):
        experiences = random.sample(self.memory, k=self.batch_size)

        states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e[0] for e in experiences])).float()
        actions = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e[1] for e in experiences])).long()
        rewards = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e[2] for e in experiences])).float()
        next_states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e[3] for e in experiences])).float()
        dones = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e[4] for e in experiences]).astype(np.uint8)).float()

        return (states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones)
```

## Policy Gradient Methods

### From Value-Based to Policy-Based

Instead of learning value functions, policy gradient methods directly optimize the policy:

$$\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot Q(s,a)]$$

### REINFORCE Algorithm

```python
class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=128):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, action_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return torch.softmax(x, dim=1)

class REINFORCEAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, lr=0.01):
        self.policy_network = PolicyNetwork(state_size, action_size)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.policy_network.parameters(), lr=lr)
        self.saved_log_probs = []
        self.rewards = []

    def select_action(self, state):
        state = torch.from_numpy(state).float().unsqueeze(0)
        probs = self.policy_network(state)
        m = torch.distributions.Categorical(probs)
        action = m.sample()
        self.saved_log_probs.append(m.log_prob(action))
        return action.item()

    def update_policy(self, gamma=0.99):
        discounted_rewards = []
        R = 0

        # Calculate discounted rewards
        for r in self.rewards[::-1]:
            R = r + gamma * R
            discounted_rewards.insert(0, R)

        # Normalize rewards
        discounted_rewards = torch.tensor(discounted_rewards)
        discounted_rewards = (discounted_rewards - discounted_rewards.mean()) / discounted_rewards.std()

        policy_loss = []
        for log_prob, reward in zip(self.saved_log_probs, discounted_rewards):
            policy_loss.append(-log_prob * reward)

        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        policy_loss = torch.cat(policy_loss).sum()
        policy_loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()

        # Clear episode data
        del self.rewards[:]
        del self.saved_log_probs[:]
```

## Actor-Critic Methods

### Combining Value and Policy Learning

Actor-Critic methods use two neural networks:

- **Actor:** Learns the policy
- **Critic:** Learns the value function

```python
class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=128):
        super(ActorCritic, self).__init__()

        # Shared layers
        self.shared = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        # Actor head
        self.actor = nn.Linear(hidden_size, action_size)

        # Critic head
        self.critic = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, state):
        shared_features = self.shared(state)

        # Policy distribution
        action_probs = torch.softmax(self.actor(shared_features), dim=-1)

        # State value
        state_value = self.critic(shared_features)

        return action_probs, state_value
```

## Advanced Algorithms

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO addresses the instability in policy gradient methods:

```python
def ppo_update(policy_net, old_policy_net, states, actions, rewards,
               advantages, clip_epsilon=0.2):

    # Current policy
    action_probs, state_values = policy_net(states)
    dist = torch.distributions.Categorical(action_probs)
    action_log_probs = dist.log_prob(actions)

    # Old policy
    with torch.no_grad():
        old_action_probs, _ = old_policy_net(states)
        old_dist = torch.distributions.Categorical(old_action_probs)
        old_action_log_probs = old_dist.log_prob(actions)

    # Ratio for clipping
    ratio = torch.exp(action_log_probs - old_action_log_probs)

    # Clipped objective
    clipped_ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, 1 - clip_epsilon, 1 + clip_epsilon)
    clipped_objective = torch.min(ratio * advantages, clipped_ratio * advantages)

    # Policy loss
    policy_loss = -clipped_objective.mean()

    # Value loss
    value_loss = nn.MSELoss()(state_values.squeeze(), rewards)

    return policy_loss + 0.5 * value_loss
```

### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

For continuous action spaces:

```python
class DDPGAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, action_low, action_high):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.action_low = action_low
        self.action_high = action_high

        # Actor networks
        self.actor_local = Actor(state_size, action_size)
        self.actor_target = Actor(state_size, action_size)

        # Critic networks
        self.critic_local = Critic(state_size, action_size)
        self.critic_target = Critic(state_size, action_size)

        # Optimizers
        self.actor_optimizer = optim.Adam(self.actor_local.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
        self.critic_optimizer = optim.Adam(self.critic_local.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

        # Noise process
        self.noise = OUNoise(action_size)
```
