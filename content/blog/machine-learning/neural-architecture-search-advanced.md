# Neural Architecture Search: Advanced Techniques and AutoML

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has evolved beyond basic search strategies to sophisticated AutoML approaches that can discover architectures rivaling human-designed networks while being orders of magnitude more efficient.

## Advanced NAS Techniques

### Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)

DARTS revolutionized NAS by making the search process differentiable, allowing gradient-based optimization instead of expensive evolutionary or reinforcement learning approaches.

### Progressive NAS

Progressive search strategies build architectures incrementally, starting with simple blocks and progressively adding complexity based on performance feedback.

### Weight Sharing Strategies

Modern NAS methods use weight sharing to reduce computational overhead by training a supernet that contains all possible architectures as subnetworks.

## Efficient Search Spaces

### Cell-Based Search

Instead of searching entire architectures, many methods focus on finding optimal cells that can be stacked to form complete networks.

### Macro vs. Micro Search

- **Macro Search**: Optimizes overall network topology
- **Micro Search**: Focuses on operations within building blocks

## Hardware-Aware NAS

Modern NAS incorporates hardware constraints directly into the search process:

- Latency-aware architecture optimization
- Memory-efficient design considerations
- Edge device deployment constraints

## Multi-Objective Optimization

Advanced NAS balances multiple objectives:

- Accuracy vs. computational efficiency
- Model size vs. inference speed
- Energy consumption vs. performance

## Practical Applications

- **Mobile Networks**: MobileNets and EfficientNets
- **Specialized Tasks**: Custom architectures for specific domains
- **Resource Constraints**: Architectures optimized for edge deployment

## Future Directions

- One-shot NAS for even faster search
- Neural architecture transfer across domains
- Integration with neural scaling laws

Neural Architecture Search continues to democratize deep learning by automating the complex process of architecture design.
