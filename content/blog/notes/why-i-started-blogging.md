# I'm not a smart person, and luckily, I know that

I’m not a smart person, and thankfully, I know that. Sometimes I spend far too much time trying to solve problems that everyone else seems to understand instantly. Maybe that’s why I started blogging in the first place. I thought that if I put my thoughts out here, people could help me correct the wrong parts of my understanding. If I want to learn, I have to show what I know, or at least what I think I know, so others can come along, suggest ideas, and offer new perspectives. That sounds like a pretty good plan to me :)))

# This is the place I can read my thoughts again

I’m not a smart person, and honestly, I’m also a bit of an airhead. I feel like a wanderer lost in a forest, marking every tree I see just to remember where I’ve been. Writing a blog works the same way for me. It helps in 2 ways. First, it shows others that I’ve been here, so maybe someone can trace my steps and rescue me (just for fun of course). Second, it reminds me that I’ve been here, so I can continue finding new paths through the messy jungle of my thoughts.

In the past, whenever I came up with a new idea or a clever solution, I kept it all in my head. Over time, my brain became overcrowded and I probably forgot 80% what I once thought about. That number, of course, is completely made up, but the loss feels real. So keeping a digital record of my thoughts started to sound like a good idea, and it turns out it really is.

Sometimes I spend hours thinking deeply about one problem, even when it doesn’t deserve that much attention. Yet every time I revisit it, I discover a new perspective. Writing helps me capture not only those new insights but also the journey of my thinking. I’ve come to believe that the way we think about a problem is often more important than the solution itself.

# Writing is thinking

Writing makes my thoughts clearer. There are problems I can’t solve no matter how long I sit and think about them, but the moment I start typing, something clicks. It feels almost magical. Maybe writing helps me focus better. Maybe it simply forces my thoughts to line up in a way that makes sense. Either way, it works.

# The way that I share my thought

Explaining something is the best way to learn it. For me, writing is another form of explaining. It’s how I share my thoughts and try to make sense of them at the same time. I believe it’s an essential skill, one that I’m still learning to improve. In a way, every post I write is a small lesson to myself, a practice in thinking out loud.

# My hobbies

I love writing about what I think and what I experience. I enjoy sharing those things with others too. There’s no deep reason behind it. I simply like it. Writing is something that makes me happy, and that’s more than enough reason to keep doing it.

# The memories

This website is my little corner for keeping memories. It’s a space where I store my thoughts and emotions, and whenever I read them again, I understand myself a bit more. It feels like having a quiet conversation with my past self. Sometimes we agree, sometimes we don’t, but it always reminds me how far I’ve come. If you’ve been reading my blog, you probably already know about 80% of what’s in my diary :))
