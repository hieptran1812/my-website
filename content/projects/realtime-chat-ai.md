## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

```typescript
// Real-time messaging with Socket.io
import { useSocket } from "@/hooks/useSocket";
import { useAI } from "@/hooks/useAI";

const ChatRoom = ({ roomId }: { roomId: string }) => {
  const { socket, messages, sendMessage } = useSocket(roomId);
  const { getSmartReplies, analyzeSentiment } = useAI();

  const handleSendMessage = async (content: string) => {
    const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(content);
    sendMessage({ content, sentiment, timestamp: Date.now() });
  };

  return (
    <div className="chat-container">
      <MessageList messages={messages} />
      <MessageInput onSend={handleSendMessage} />
      <SmartReplies suggestions={getSmartReplies(messages)} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Backend Infrastructure

- **Node.js Server**: Express.js with Socket.io integration
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections for instant messaging
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for natural language processing
- **Database**: MongoDB for message storage and user data
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and real-time data
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication system

### AI Integration

```javascript
// AI service for conversation analysis
class AIService {
  async analyzeSentiment(message) {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content:
            "Analyze the sentiment of the following message and respond with positive, negative, or neutral.",
        },
        { role: "user", content: message },
      ],
    });

    return response.choices[0].message.content;
  }

  async generateSmartReplies(conversationHistory) {
    // Generate contextual reply suggestions
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content:
            "Generate 3 brief, contextual reply suggestions based on the conversation history.",
        },
        ...conversationHistory,
      ],
    });

    return this.parseReplies(response.choices[0].message.content);
  }
}
```
